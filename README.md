# Titanic_survival_prediction
This project required the following libraries -

Numpy , Panda , Matplotlib , scikit- learn and model of machine learning.
 
I have used the Google Collab.

The steps involved in making the project are : 

1. First, import  the csv file for observation.
2. Looking at the data , means the column is imported correctly or not.
3. Showing the data with the help of head() and tail() method.
4. Cleaning the data ( null, unnecessary / unreadable data )
5. Performing the required steps to analyze the data and checking with the required model and testing the accuracy of the model.
